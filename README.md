This is a currently in-progress project that aims provide investors a tool to indentify the best ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) to invest in, based on a variety of their investment preferences. It works more than just a mere filtering tool across a database of securities, because it weights relative importance of various investment criterion to the investor, and specifically prevents the presented data suggestions from being too narrow/broad, by adaptively adjusting the output to include the best set of suggestions, given the user's inputs. The tool using k-Means clustering and k-Nearest Neighbours classifications.


### Prerequisites

This project is still in development. It can be run in R-Studio if you are curious to see how the tool works so far.
